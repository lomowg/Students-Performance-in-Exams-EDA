# Students Performance in Exams
In this project, I did EDA (exploratory data analysis) of a dataset with various information about the grades obtained by students in different subjects. The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website: [Students Performance in Exams](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams)

The following aspects were investigated as part of the analysis:
* Data analysis including boxplot plots for grades in different subjects (maths, reading, writing), distribution of grades in each subject, distribution of total grades, distribution of students by gender, parental education level, ethnicity, courses of study and lunch.
* Analyses of correlation between the various independent variables were performed
* Performed multiple linear regression analysis to determine the effect of categorical variables (gender, ethnicity, parental education level, lunch, and courses of study) on students' summative grades.

# Tools
For the analysis I used the Python language and the corresponding libraries:
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels
